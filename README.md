# Pick Your Poison! 

This webpage will be used to find different submissions.  For each submission you will be able to easily find stats about the submissions usage in the UFC, as well as a link to my favorite youtube tutorial for the user-selected submission.   

## In Pick Your Poison!, users will be able to:
- Find submissions that correlate to the clicked on body part
- See a list of stats that correlate to the clicked on submission 
- Click on Youtube links to tutorials for the selected submission 
- When hovering cursor over a body part it will highlight that body part.  Same for the submission. 
- toggle music on and off 

## In addition, this project will include:


- Will display images of UFC fighters who have the most wins by selected submission  
- Will be very user friendly and have information build from left to right.

### API 

I will have seeded all the data being displayed by looking up stats on google.  

### Plan of Attack

I plan on completing the Seeding for all the data by Friday Night or Saturday afternoon. This includes getting all the classes built and all data for each submission populated.  Then Sunday and Monday i will spend time putting things on the webpage and styling.  I will begin making the clickable things work once I'm satisfied with how the page is looking.  Tuesday through Thursday i will continue to button things up styling wise and work through any bugs i come across with making the page interactive.
